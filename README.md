### Mission

- Our mission is to equip CUNY students with the resources they need to jumpstart their careers in tech.

- Developed and delivered with the CUNY Institute for Software Design and Development and industry leaders, CTP is designed to provide students with industry exposure to software development and a connection to tech jobs post-graduation.

- The NYC Tech Talent Pipeline is a multi-million industry partnership designed to support the growth of the City's tech sector and deliver quality jobs for New Yorkers and quality talent for New York’s businesses.

### General Information

- CUNY Tech Prep was established in 2015 to serve computer science and computing students from the 11 four-year CUNY Colleges that are preparing to enter the workforce. Students accepted into CTP each academic year participate in a program designed to prepare them for the challenges of the job search and technical work in the industry.

- The curriculum is designed around three pillars:

  ## Industry Insight

  - Our technical curriculum offers two tracks: full stack web development using modern JavaScript and data science using Python. The curriculums are developed, evaluated, and taught by industry experts.

  - In both tracks, students work in teams to design, develop, and deploy projects where they learn and apply tools, concepts, and processes — Git, TDD and automated testing, CI/CD, agile, web security, etc. — desired by high-tech employers.

  ## Project Experience with Industry Mentorship

  - Students work in teams on projects they propose, design, and implement. Each team is assigned a mentor that supervises the work, introduces the software development life cycle and best practices, and performs code reviews.

  - CTP instructors, TA's, and mentors all have extensive current and past industry experience as software engineers and data scientists.

  ## Professional Development

  - It takes more than technical skills to land a job in tech! That's why CUNY Tech Prep takes a holistic approach to professional development. Our fellows have access to:
  
    - 1:1 Career Coaching, including behavioral interview practice In-class workshops led by our career coaches on topics such as networking, project pitching, job search strategy, resumes, and communication skills

    - Mock technical interviews conducted by industry professionals

    - Workshops led by industry professionals

    - Assistance with crafting technical resumes
